In this tutorial, you will learn about different tree traversal techniques. Also, you will find working examples of different tree traversal methods in Java.  Traversing a tree means visiting every node in the tree. You might, for instance, want to add all the values in the tree or find the largest one. For all these operations, you will need to visit each node of the tree.  Linear data structures like arrays, stacks, queues, and linked list have only one way to read the data. But a hierarchical data structure like a tree can be traversed in different ways.
