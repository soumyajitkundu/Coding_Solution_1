Traversing a tree means visiting every node in the tree. You might, for instance, want to add all the values in the tree or find the largest one. For all these operations, you will need to visit each node of the tree.  Linear data structures like arrays, stacks, queues, and linked list have only one way to read the data. But a hierarchical data structure like a tree can be traversed in different ways.

There can be three types of traversal.
## Inorder traversal
1.First, visit all the nodes in the left subtree
2.Then the root node
3.Visit all the nodes in the right subtree

##Preorder traversal
1.Visit root node
2.Visit all the nodes in the left subtree
3.Visit all the nodes in the right subtree

##Postorder traversal
1.Visit all the nodes in the left subtree
2.Visit all the nodes in the right subtree
3.Visit the root node
